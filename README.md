# React Native
## Introduction

This app was created to teach React in SISTCA's Lab Script at _Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto_.

We start explaining the basics of React Native. After that, we give a simple exercise that puts all the basick together. To finish it off we a challenge, i..e, an harder version of the previous exercise where the student will need to do some research on their own - search for libraries and read their documentation.

## Set up your own React Native App

To make your very first React Native app, you need to install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager),

```console
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs npm -y
```

You can confirm if it is installed by checking the installed version.

```console
node -v
npm -v
npx -v
```

Start the development server
```console
npx react-native start
```

Then, open a new command prompt window, navigate to your project folder, and run your app on an Android emulator or connected device
```console
npx react-native run-android
```
